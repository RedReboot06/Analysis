# Analysis
The program we use to analyze and visualize the scouting data collected at competitions.

Analysis.ipynb is a JupyterNotebook file, that when run analyzes the data in a CSV file, provided that the data is under the predetermined header order- which can be found in Scout.CSV, the file that Analysis.ipynb analizes. The results, sorted, can be seen in Results.csv, and the PDF's are a collection of assorted graphs that are generated based on the data in Scout.CSV.
In order to run, just import your data into a file named Scout.csv, and run analysis. Be sure that the data follows the preset headers, and that the file name is correct.
Intended to be run fully offline, as long as the spreadsheet used to paste data from the scouting app is offline enabled.
This was created by Oliver Kolodner in entirety.
